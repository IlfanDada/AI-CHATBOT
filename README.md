Welcome to my AI Chatbot project repository! This project was an exciting part of my coursework where I ventured into the world of conversational AI using Python. I developed this chatbot in Jupyter Labs, leveraging powerful libraries like NLTK and NumPy.

Key Features of the Project:

Chatbot Framework: I built the chatbot from scratch using Python, focusing on natural language processing to enable it to understand and respond to user queries effectively.

Utilisation of NLTK and NumPy: For text processing and mathematical operations, I integrated NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and NumPy, ensuring efficient handling of linguistic data and array manipulations.

Neural Network Implementation: The core of this chatbot is powered by a neural network, which I designed and trained to interpret user inputs. This neural network is the backbone of the chatbot's decision-making process.

Research and Analysis: Before coding, I conducted extensive research on various types of AI technologies. This helped me understand different approaches to AI development and their applicability to chatbot technology.

Incorporation of Diagrams: To clarify complex concepts and streamline the development process, I created and included various diagrams. These served as visual aids in understanding and constructing the chatbot's architecture.

Big O Notation in Optimisation: I employed Big O Notation to analyse and refine the efficiency of my chatbot, particularly focusing on its neural network layers. This involved optimising the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions to enhance the chatbot's processing speed and response accuracy.

Practical Application of ReLU Layers: The use of ReLU layers in the neural network was critical. By understanding their computational complexity and applying Big O notation, I was able to make informed decisions to optimise these layers for better performance.

Closing Thoughts:

This project was a comprehensive journey through AI chatbot development, combining theoretical research with practical application. The process not only enhanced my technical skills but also gave me valuable insights into the intricacies of AI and natural language processing.
